== The HTML5 bundle
'''

Testatoo comes with a bunch of predefined HTML components. These components are not only the standard representation of HTML elements,
but also a powerful base to build your own components. Each component supports States and Properties. One of the strengths of Testatoo
is the ability to add support for new States and Properties and to override existing States and Properties, on existing or new components.
