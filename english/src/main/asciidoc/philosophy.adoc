== Philosophy

Testatoo is a strongly opinionated tool. There is no anonymous "WebElement". Everything needs to be a *COMPONENT*.
Testatoo is a typed UI component tool.

In the previous sample the line:
[source, java]
-----------------------------------------------------
TextField search = $('#lst-ib') as InputTypeText
-----------------------------------------------------
expressed that we try to find an *HTML5 input of type text with id: 'lst-ib'* => <input type="text"/> but we want to use it
as a formal TextField

The associated import is :
[source, java]
-----------------------------------------------------
import org.testatoo.core.component.field.TextField
import org.testatoo.bundle.html5.input.InputTypeText
-----------------------------------------------------

[NOTE]
The challenge it's to never have import on a bundle (everything int the package org.testatoo.bundle) but as possible
only import from core (org.testatoo.core.component.field.TextField). The core package is like an Universal UI Domain definition.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Testatoo provides by default the *HTML5* bundle to interact with basic HTML5 components
